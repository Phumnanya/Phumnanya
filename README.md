👨🏽‍💻 Hi, I’m Eustace Mbanefo – a frontend enthusiast😊 who flirts with the backend😉.

By day, I craft elegant and responsive interfaces with CSS(Bootstrap/Tailwind), JavaScript/Typescript, React, and Next.js — turning wireframes into wow-frames🤯. By night (or whenever bugs arise), I sneak into the backend world🌚, whispering sweet nothings to Python🐍 and Flask until everything works🌐... or at least doesn’t crash😁.

I believe code should be clean, apps should be fast, and UIs should feel like butter — smooth, satisfying, and slightly addictive. Whether it's a landing page, a dashboard, or an entire web app, I bring a passion for user experience and an eye for detail (I fight with pixels until they fall in line😁).

🧠 Currently sharpening my fullstack skills and occasionally googling “how to center a div” like every other dev since 2005.

🔧 Tools I wield like a digital wizard:

Frontend: CSS (Bootstrap/TailwindCSS), JavaScript/Typescript, React, and Next.js

Backend: Python (well enough to make it listen and hiss), Flask (my backend sidekick)

Bonus: Git, APIs, Zustand, React-query, Vitest & react-testing library and the occasional Stack Overflow rabbit hole


🚀 Let’s build something people actually enjoy using — and maybe throw in a meme or two along the way.
